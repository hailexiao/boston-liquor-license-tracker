  "database-page.license-type.header2": "What does each type of license mean?",
  "database-page.license-type.header2-paragraph": "Boston has several different types of licenses from a variety of different laws and statutes, which can lead to some confusion when applying for a license. These licenses can range from those that apply city-wide to licenses for specific areas of Boston. Below are some basic definitions of each license type to aid you in your search.",
  "database-page.license-type.transferable-header2": "Transferable Licenses",
  "database-page.license-type.transferable-paragraph": "Licenses that have no restrictions preventing them from being transferred to another business and/or another part of the city of Boston. Most of the licenses in Boston are of this type, and all licenses issued before 2006 fall under this category.",
  "database-page.license-type.nonTransferable-header3": "Non-Transferable Licenses",
  "database-page.license-type.nonTransferable-paragraph": "Restrictions are placed on certain licenses, preventing them from being transferred outside of their legally designated area of Boston.

  "caseStudy.title": "Why is this important?",
  "caseStudy.par1": "Getting a Liquor License in Boston has long meant being part of an \"In Club\" of restaurant owners, hospitality companies, and lawyers who've mastered the process. It has historically meant newcomers to the space have struggled to obtain these artificially scarce licenses and has created droughts in neighborhoods all over the city. Often in neighborhoods seen as traditionally less white with more diverse character.",
  "caseStudy.par2": "Recent changes to Boston's License system have made moves to improve access to Licenses. A new law passed in 2024 aims to give parts of the city specific Licenses and allow locals to open businesses. But this is just the start, tracking available licenses is still difficult and often out of reach to some members of Boston's community.",
